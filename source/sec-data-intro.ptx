  <title>Introduction</title>

  <p> Data is all around us and plays an increasingly important role in our lives. 
    Our goal in this course is to understand the role data plays in our lives,
    and more importantly how data helps us <em>make better decisions</em> in our lives.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether we are at work, coaching a child's team, or advocating for a policy change to 
    the local government, using data provides a more rigorous approach to decision-making.
