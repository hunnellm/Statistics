  "body": " Introduction  Data is all around us and plays an increasingly important role in our lives. Our goal in this course is to understand the role data plays in our lives, and more importantly how data helps us make better decisions in our lives.  Whether we are at work, coaching a child's team, or advocating for a policy change to the local government, using data provides a more rigorous approach to decision-making.  "

The individuals for a dataset are the collection of objects on whom we record measurements.      The variables are the features of the individuals that we record. They can be people, things, or more abstract concepts.    Admittedly, these definitions are a bit vague, but that allows them to apply in lots of situations. Let's make things more concrete with some specific examples.   Here's an example with people    Here's the solution       Here's an example with objects     Here's the solution      Here's an example with abstract things    Here's the solution     "
